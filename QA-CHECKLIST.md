## Notes

This checklist represents Milestone 7.1 (Quality Assurance) from the implementation plan. Many items require manual testing or browser-based tools that can be run by the user. Claude has verified:

1. Code quality (TypeScript, ESLint)
2. Build process (production build succeeds)
3. Code structure and best practices

User should manually verify:
1. Browser functionality testing
2. Performance metrics (Lighthouse)
3. Accessibility (axe DevTools, WAVE)
4. Cross-browser compatibility
5. Mobile responsiveness
