## 🎯 How to Use This Backlog

### Option 1: Human Development (Manual)

**Start Here**:
1. Read `backlog/README.md`
2. Read `backlog/epic-01-foundation/EPIC.md`
3. Open `task-01-01-01-initialize-nextjs.md`
4. Follow the step-by-step guide
5. Check off acceptance criteria
6. Mark task complete in README.md
7. Move to next task

**Benefits**:
- Clear instructions for every task
- No ambiguity about what to build
- Testing requirements specified
- Definition of done clear

### Option 2: AI-Assisted Development

**With Claude Code, Cursor, or Windsurf**:

1. **Point AI to task file**:
   ```
   Execute task: backlog/epic-01-foundation/story-01-development-environment/task-01-01-01-initialize-nextjs.md
   ```

2. **AI reads the prompt** and understands:
   - Objective
   - Current vs desired state
   - Acceptance criteria
   - Implementation steps
   - Testing requirements

3. **AI executes**:
   - Runs commands
   - Creates files
   - Runs tests
   - Verifies acceptance criteria

4. **AI reports completion**:
   ```
   ✅ TASK-01-01-01 Complete
   Next task: TASK-01-01-02
   ```

5. **Human reviews** and approves

**Benefits**:
- AI has complete context for each task
- Reduces back-and-forth questions
- Faster implementation
- Consistent quality

### Option 3: Team Development

**Multi-Person Team**:

1. **Sprint Planning**: Review `backlog/README.md` together
2. **Assign Stories**: Each developer takes 1-2 stories
3. **Daily Standups**: Reference task IDs (TASK-01-02-03)
4. **Track Progress**: Update README.md after each task
5. **Code Reviews**: Use task acceptance criteria as review checklist

**Benefits**:
- Clear work division
- Everyone knows dependencies
- Consistent task structure
- Easy progress tracking

## 📋 Next Steps

### Immediate Action

**Step 1**: Review What Was Generated
```bash
cd backlog
cat README.md
cat epic-01-foundation/EPIC.md
cat epic-01-foundation/story-01-development-environment/task-01-01-01-initialize-nextjs.md
```

**Step 2**: Understand the Pattern

The task prompt `task-01-01-01-initialize-nextjs.md` is the **template**. All 155+ tasks should follow this exact structure:
- Objective
- Context
- Acceptance Criteria
- Implementation Guide
- Resources
- Testing Requirements
- Learning Notes
- Estimated Effort
- Definition of Done
- AI Agent Instructions

**Step 3**: Generate Remaining Tasks (Optional)

If you want all 155+ task files created now:

1. Use the BACKLOG-GENERATOR-PROMPT.md again
2. Ask AI: "Create all remaining task files following the pattern in task-01-01-01-initialize-nextjs.md"
3. AI will generate all tasks using the same comprehensive template

**OR** generate tasks on-demand as you need them.

**Step 4**: Start Development

Execute the first task:
```bash
cd backlog/epic-01-foundation/story-01-development-environment
cat task-01-01-01-initialize-nextjs.md
# Follow the instructions
```

## 🔧 Customization

### Adding More Tasks

If you discover additional tasks during development:

1. **Create new task file**: `task-XX-YY-ZZ-description.md`
2. **Use the template**: Copy structure from `task-01-01-01-initialize-nextjs.md`
3. **Update EPIC.md**: Add task to story's task list
4. **Update README.md**: Increment task count

### Modifying Existing Tasks

As you learn more about requirements:

1. **Edit task file directly**: Update acceptance criteria, steps, etc.
2. **Update estimate**: If actual time differs, note it in task file
3. **Document learnings**: Add to "Learning Notes" section

### Tracking Progress

Update `backlog/README.md` after completing each task:

```markdown
**Epic Progress**:
- [x] EPIC-01: Foundation (25/25 tasks) ✅ COMPLETE
- [ ] EPIC-02: Core Pages (12/45 tasks) 🟡 IN PROGRESS
```
