# Epic: Core Pages & Content

**ID**: EPIC-02

**Source**: Phase 2 from planning/IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md

---

## Description

Implement all essential website pages with mobile-responsive design, brand colors, and mock data integration. This epic delivers the core user-facing pages: Homepage with hero and value propositions, Services page with pricing, Locations page with Google Maps, Membership comparison page, and About/Contact pages. All pages will be optimized for mobile-first experience and use the brand colors extracted from the actual facility.

## Business Value

These pages are the face of the business online. Without them, there's no website to show customers. This epic:
- Establishes online presence with all core information
- Showcases membership options (70% of revenue source)
- Provides location information for both facilities
- Builds trust through about/contact pages
- Implements mobile-first design (70% of bookings occur on mobile)

**Critical**: This epic must be completed before AI features, optimization, or launch.

## Technical Notes

### Brand Colors Integration

All pages MUST use the official brand colors from `planning/BRAND-COLORS.md`:

- **Primary Blue**: `#00A3E0` (navigation, headers, primary actions)
- **Orange**: `#FF6600` (CTAs, "Join Now" buttons, "Most Popular" badges)
- **Yellow**: `#FFD700` (highlights, feature badges)
- **White**: `#FFFFFF` (backgrounds, contrast)

### Mobile-First Design

**Breakpoints** (Tailwind defaults):
- Mobile: `< 640px` (design for this first)
- Tablet: `640px - 1024px`
- Desktop: `> 1024px`

**Mobile Navigation**:
- Hamburger menu (slide-in)
- Sticky header
- Click-to-call phone number prominent

### Mock Data Integration

All content comes from Markdown files in `v1/src/data/`:

```typescript
// Example: Loading locations
import { getLocations } from '@/lib/data'

export default function LocationsPage() {
  const locations = getLocations() // Returns typed Location[]

  return (
    <div>
      {locations.map(location => (
        <LocationCard key={location.id} location={location} />
      ))}
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Google Maps Integration

**API Key**: Store in `.env.local`:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

**Library**: `@googlemaps/js-api-loader`

### Images

**POC Phase**: Use mock images from:
- Unsplash (https://unsplash.com)
- Pexels (https://pexels.com)
- Project images folder: `images/`

**Next.js Image Component**: Always use `next/image` for optimization
```tsx
import Image from 'next/image'

<Image
  src="/images/car-wash.jpg"
  alt="Car wash facility"
  width={800}
  height={600}
  priority // For above-fold images
/>
```
