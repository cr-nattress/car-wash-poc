## 🎯 How to Generate Remaining Files

### Option 1: Generate All Now

Ask Claude Code:

```
"Using the templates in backlog/, generate:
1. EPIC.md for all 7 epics (following epic-01-foundation/EPIC.md pattern)
2. STORY.md for all 24 stories
3. All 155 task .md files (following task-01-01-01-initialize-nextjs.md pattern)

Reference planning/IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md for details.
Ensure all paths point to v1/ directory."
```

### Option 2: Generate On-Demand

Generate files as you need them:

1. **Starting Epic 2?** Generate epic-02-core-pages/EPIC.md
2. **Starting a story?** Generate that story's STORY.md file
3. **Starting a task?** Generate that specific task .md file

### Option 3: Use AI Agent Autonomously

Point Claude Code to the backlog and say:
```
"Execute the backlog starting with Epic 1.
Generate any missing files using the templates as patterns.
Work through all 155 tasks sequentially."
```
