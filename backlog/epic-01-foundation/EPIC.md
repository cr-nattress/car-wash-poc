# Epic: Foundation & Setup

**ID**: EPIC-01

**Source**: Phase 1 from planning/IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md

---

## Description

Establish the foundational infrastructure for the car wash website including Next.js project setup, Tailwind CSS configuration with brand colors, mock data structure, and core layout components. This epic delivers the development environment and base components that all other features will build upon.

## Business Value

Without a solid foundation, all subsequent development will be slowed or blocked. This epic ensures:
- Development environment is consistent and optimized
- Brand colors (Cyan Blue `#00A3E0`, Orange `#FF6600`) are correctly implemented from day 1
- Mock data structure supports rapid prototyping
- Core layout components provide reusable UI patterns

**Critical Path**: All other epics depend on EPIC-01 completion.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Next.js 14+ project initialized with TypeScript
- [ ] Tailwind CSS configured with exact brand colors from facility photos
- [ ] Project deploys successfully to Netlify
- [ ] Mock data files (Markdown) load correctly with TypeScript types
- [ ] Header and Footer components render on all pages
- [ ] Reusable UI components (Button, Card, Input) exist
- [ ] Development environment documented in README

## Estimated Duration

**Week 1 (Days 1-5)**
- Total: 25 tasks
- Estimated effort: 40-50 hours

## Dependencies

**Requires**:
- None (starting point)

**Blocks**:
- EPIC-02 (Core Pages)
- EPIC-03 (Mobile Optimization)
- EPIC-04 (AI Integration)
- All other epics

- gray-matter for parsing Markdown frontmatter
- Netlify for hosting and deployment

### Brand Colors (from actual facility)
```typescript
colors: {
  primary: {
    500: '#00a3e0',  // Cyan blue from building exterior
    700: '#006186',  // Darker for footer
  },
  accent: {
    500: '#ff6600',  // Orange from OPEN 24/7 signage
  },
  yellow: {
    500: '#ffd700',  // Yellow from equipment
  },
}
```
