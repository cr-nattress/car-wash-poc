## Changes Made to Implementation Plan

### 1. Updated Tailwind Config (Line 369-407)

**Before**:
```typescript
colors: {
  primary: {
    500: '#0066cc', // Generic blue
  },
  accent: {
    500: '#ff6600', // Orange (correct)
  },
}
```

**After**:
```typescript
colors: {
  primary: {
    50: '#e6f7ff',   // Very light cyan blue
    100: '#b3e5ff',  // Light cyan blue
    500: '#00a3e0',  // Main brand blue (from building exterior)
    700: '#006186',  // Deep cyan
    900: '#00202d',  // Almost black cyan
  },
  accent: {
    50: '#fff3e6',   // Very light orange
    500: '#ff6600',  // Main accent orange (from OPEN 24/7 signage)
