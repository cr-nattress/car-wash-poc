## 📖 Complete Workflow

### Stage 1: Planning (Day 1)

**Goal**: Convert your idea into a detailed implementation plan.

#### Step 1.1: Define Objective

Create `OBJECTIVE.md`:

```markdown
# Objective: Task Management App

## Goal
Build a web-based task management app for remote teams
with real-time collaboration.

## Success Criteria
- Users can create/edit/delete tasks
- Tasks assigned to team members
- Real-time sync across browsers
- Launch by March 2025

## Target Platform
Web (SPA - Single Page Application)

## Constraints
- Timeline: 12 weeks
- Team: 2 full-stack developers
- Budget: <$500/month hosting
- Must integrate with Slack

## Tech Stack Preferences
- Frontend: React or Vue (recommend based on team)
- Backend: Node.js
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Hosting: Vercel/Railway/Fly.io
```

**Time**: 15-30 minutes

#### Step 1.2: Add Research (Optional)

Add any research or documentation:

```
your-project/
├── OBJECTIVE.md
├── research/
│   ├── competitor-analysis.md  (Studied Trello, Asana)
│   ├── tech-stack-research.md  (React vs Vue comparison)
│   └── realtime-patterns.md    (WebSocket vs SSE research)
└── constraints/
    └── slack-api-limits.md     (Slack integration constraints)
```

**Time**: 1-3 hours (if you do research)

**Or skip**: Planning agent works without research, but less specific.

#### Step 1.3: Generate Implementation Plan

**Use**: `GENERIC-PLANNING-PROMPT.md`

**Command**:
```
User: "Create a detailed implementation plan based on OBJECTIVE.md
       and all research files in this directory"

AI: [Reads all files]
    [Analyzes technology stack]
    [Generates comprehensive plan]
    [Saves to IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md]
```

**Output**: `IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md` (50-150 pages)
- 7 Phases (Foundation → Development → Testing → Deploy)
- 28 Milestones (deliverable checkpoints)
- 142 Tasks (granular work items)
- Dependencies mapped
- Risks identified
- Timeline: 12 weeks

**Time**: 5-10 minutes (AI generation)

**Review**: 30-60 minutes (review and adjust)

---

### Stage 2: Backlog Creation (Day 1-2)

**Goal**: Convert abstract plan into executable task prompts.

#### Step 2.1: Generate Backlog Structure

**Use**: `BACKLOG-GENERATOR-PROMPT.md`

**Command**:
```
User: "Convert IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md into backlog structure"

AI: [Reads implementation plan]
    [Maps phases → epics]
    [Maps milestones → stories]
    [Maps tasks → task prompts]
    [Generates /backlog folder]
```

**Output**: `/backlog` folder structure
```
backlog/
├── README.md                    (Start here)
├── BACKLOG-INDEX.md             (All 142 tasks listed)

├── epic-06-integration/
│   └── ... (2 stories, 8 tasks)
└── epic-07-deployment/
    └── ... (1 story, 2 tasks)
```

**Time**: 10-15 minutes (AI generation)

#### Step 2.2: Review and Customize

Read the generated backlog:

```bash
cd backlog
cat README.md                    # Overview
cat BACKLOG-INDEX.md             # All tasks
cat epic-01-foundation/EPIC.md   # First epic
```

**Customize if needed**:
- Adjust task priorities
- Add more detail to specific tasks
- Remove unnecessary tasks
- Split large tasks

**Time**: 1-2 hours

---

### Stage 3: Execution (Week 1-12)

**Goal**: Build the software, task by task.

#### Step 3.1: Start with First Task

**Navigate**:
```bash
cd backlog/epic-01-foundation/story-01-project-setup
cat task-01-initialize-repo.md
```

**You see complete executable prompt**:
```markdown
# Task: Initialize Git Repository

**ID**: TASK-01-01-01

## 🎯 Objective
Create Git repository with proper .gitignore and initial commit.

## 📋 Context
**Why**: Version control from day 1
**Current**: Empty directory
**Desired**: Git repo with initial structure

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Git initialized
- [ ] .gitignore for Node.js
- [ ] README.md created
- [ ] Initial commit made
- [ ] Remote connected (GitHub/GitLab)

## 🔧 Implementation Guide

Step 1: Initialize Git
```bash
git init
```

Step 2: Create .gitignore
```bash
cat > .gitignore << EOF
node_modules/
dist/
.env
.env.local
.DS_Store
EOF
```

Step 3: Create README
```bash
cat > README.md << EOF
# Task Management App

[Project description from OBJECTIVE.md]
EOF
```

Step 4: Initial commit
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "chore: initialize repository"
```

Step 5: Connect remote
```bash
git remote add origin <your-repo-url>
git push -u origin main
```

## 🧪 Testing
- [ ] `git status` shows clean working tree
- [ ] `git log` shows initial commit
- [ ] `git remote -v` shows remote URL

## ✔️ Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Repository pushed to remote
- [ ] Team can clone repository
```

#### Step 3.2: Execute Tasks

**Three Execution Patterns**:

**Pattern A: Human Manual Execution**
```
1. Read task prompt
2. Follow implementation guide
3. Verify acceptance criteria
4. Mark complete in README
5. Move to next task
```

**Pattern B: AI-Assisted Execution**
```
1. Point AI to task file
2. AI reads and asks clarifying questions
3. AI implements with your guidance
4. You review and approve
5. Mark complete
```

**Pattern C: AI Autonomous Execution** (Claude Code, Cursor)
```
1. Load task file as prompt
2. AI reads context
3. AI searches for patterns
4. AI implements completely
5. AI runs tests
6. AI marks complete
7. You review batch of completed tasks
```

**Recommended**: Start with Pattern A (manual), move to Pattern B (assisted), then Pattern C (autonomous) as you gain confidence.

#### Step 3.3: Track Progress

Update `backlog/README.md` after each task:

```markdown
## Progress Tracking

**Week 1**: Foundation
- [x] EPIC-01: Foundation (15/15 tasks) ✓
  - [x] STORY-01-01: Project Setup (5/5) ✓
  - [x] STORY-01-02: CI/CD (4/4) ✓
  - [x] STORY-01-03: Architecture (6/6) ✓

**Week 2**: Backend Development
- [ ] EPIC-02: Backend (12/28 tasks) 🟡 In Progress
  - [x] STORY-02-01: Database (8/8) ✓
  - [ ] STORY-02-02: API Framework (4/8) 🟡
  - [ ] STORY-02-03: Authentication (0/6) 🔵
  - [ ] STORY-02-04: Core Endpoints (0/4) 🔵
  - [ ] STORY-02-05: WebSockets (0/2) 🔵

**Overall**: 27/142 tasks (19% complete)
**On Track**: Yes (target: 20% by week 2)
```

#### Step 3.4: Adapt and Iterate

Plans change. When you learn something:

**If a task is harder than expected**:
```
1. Update task file with new findings
2. Add more subtasks if needed
3. Adjust time estimate
4. Update IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md for future reference
```

**If a task is no longer needed**:
```
1. Mark task as "Cancelled" in README
2. Document why in task file
3. Remove from BACKLOG-INDEX.md
```

**If a new task is discovered**:
```
1. Create new task file following template
2. Add to appropriate story
3. Add to BACKLOG-INDEX.md
4. Update time estimates
```

## 🔄 Complete Example Walkthrough

### Example Project: Recipe Sharing App

#### Day 1 Morning: Define Objective (30 min)

Create `OBJECTIVE.md`:
```markdown
# Objective: Recipe Sharing Platform

## Goal
Build a web platform where users can share recipes,
rate them, and create shopping lists.

## Success Criteria
- Users can post/edit/delete recipes
- Users can rate and comment
- Generate shopping list from recipe
- Search and filter recipes
- Launch by June 2025

## Target Platform
Web (mobile-responsive)

## Constraints
- Timeline: 16 weeks
- Team: Just me (solo developer)
- Budget: Free tier hosting only
- No prior React experience (learning as I go)

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: React (learning)
- Backend: Node.js + Express
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Auth: Firebase Auth (free tier)
- Hosting: Vercel (frontend) + Railway (backend)
```

#### Day 1 Afternoon: Generate Plan (2 hours)

Run planning agent:
```
Result: IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md
- 8 Phases (includes learning time)
- 32 Milestones
- 168 Tasks (smaller tasks due to solo dev)
- Timeline: 18 weeks (adjusted for learning)
```

Review plan, realize Phase 3 (Advanced Features) can be post-launch.
Remove from plan, now 16 weeks fits timeline.

#### Day 2: Generate Backlog (1 hour)

Run backlog generator:
```
Result: /backlog folder
- 7 epics (removed advanced features)
- 28 stories
- 142 tasks
```

Review backlog, understand first epic (Foundation) completely.

#### Week 1: Foundation (15 tasks)

Execute tasks using Pattern A (manual):
```
Day 1-2: Project Setup (5 tasks)
- Initialize repo
- Install dependencies
- Configure TypeScript
- Set up linting
- Create folder structure

Day 3-4: CI/CD (4 tasks)
- GitHub Actions
- Automated tests
- Build checks
- Deploy preview

Day 5: Architecture (6 tasks)
- Database design
- API structure
- Auth flow design
- Component architecture
- State management plan
- Documentation
```

**Actual time**: 32 hours (estimated 40, came in under!)

#### Week 2-3: Backend Core (28 tasks)

Switch to Pattern B (AI-assisted) for repetitive tasks:
```
Week 2:
- Database schema (AI generates, I review)
- Migrations (AI creates, I test)
- API framework (I set up, AI helps with middleware)

Week 3:
- Auth endpoints (AI implements, I test)
- Recipe CRUD (AI implements 80%, I add validation)
- Rating system (Pair with AI)
```

**Learning**: AI is great for boilerplate, I focus on business logic.

#### Week 4-7: Frontend (35 tasks)

Learning React, so Pattern A initially:
```
Week 4: Learn React basics while building
Week 5-6: Use Pattern B (AI helps with React patterns)
Week 7: Pattern C for repetitive components
```

**Insight**: Task prompts include React patterns, helps learning.

#### Week 8-11: Features (42 tasks)

Now comfortable, mostly Pattern C:
```
AI implements most tasks autonomously
I review, test, and approve
Focus my time on UX polish
```

#### Week 12-14: Testing & Polish (12 tasks)

Mix of Pattern A and B:
```
Write E2E tests (AI helps)
Fix bugs (manual debugging)
Performance optimization (AI suggests, I implement)
Accessibility (manual review)
```

#### Week 15-16: Deployment (8 tasks)

Pattern A (want to understand deployment):
```
Set up production environment
Configure DNS
Set up monitoring
Launch!
```

**Result**: Shipped on time! 🚀

## 💡 Best Practices Learned

### 1. Start Conservative, Iterate

**Don't**:
- Try to use AI for everything on day 1
- Skip reading task prompts
- Execute blindly

**Do**:
- Start manual (Pattern A)
- Understand patterns
- Gradually increase AI autonomy
- Review AI work thoroughly at first

### 2. Task Prompts Are Gold

Even if not using AI, task prompts are valuable:
- Clear checklist of what to do
- Testing requirements spelled out
- Common pitfalls flagged
- Links to relevant docs

### 3. Update as You Learn

Your plan will be wrong. That's fine!
- Adjust time estimates
- Add missing tasks
- Remove unnecessary tasks
- Document lessons learned

### 4. Celebrate Milestones

Don't just grind through tasks:
- Mark stories complete
- Deploy to staging after each epic
- Demo to users/stakeholders
- Take breaks between phases

### 5. Maintain Traceability

Always know "why":
```
Why am I implementing this task?
→ It's part of Story 02-03 (Authentication)
→ Which is in Epic 02 (Backend Core)
→ Which achieves Phase 2 of the plan
→ Which enables the "secure user access" goal from OBJECTIVE.md
```

## 📊 Success Metrics

Track these to improve:

### Velocity
```
Estimated hours vs actual hours
Week 1: 40 estimated, 32 actual (0.8x)
Week 2: 40 estimated, 45 actual (1.125x)
Adjust future estimates by 1.0x average
```

### Quality
```
Bugs per 100 tasks: 5 (good: <10)
Test coverage: 82% (good: >80%)
Rework rate: 8% (good: <10%)
```

### AI Effectiveness
```
Pattern A (manual): 8 hours/task average
Pattern B (assisted): 5 hours/task (37% faster)
Pattern C (autonomous): 3 hours/task (62% faster)

But: Review time increases with autonomy
Pattern C requires 1 hour review/task
Net savings: Still 50% faster
```

## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Over-Planning

**Problem**: Spend weeks planning, never start coding.

**Solution**:
- Spend max 2 days on plan
- Plan is a guide, not gospel
- Start executing by day 3

### Pitfall 2: Under-Planning

**Problem**: Jump straight to coding, no direction.

**Solution**:
- Spend minimum 1 day on objective + plan
- Even a rough plan is better than no plan

### Pitfall 3: Ignoring the Plan

**Problem**: Create plan, then ignore it completely.

**Solution**:
- Reference backlog daily
- Update when plan changes
- Use as communication tool with team/AI

### Pitfall 4: Trusting AI Blindly

**Problem**: AI generates code, you don't review, bugs slip through.

**Solution**:
- Always review AI-generated code
- Run tests
- Understand what AI did
- Start with high review, gradually reduce

### Pitfall 5: Analysis Paralysis

**Problem**: Read all 142 tasks, feel overwhelmed, do nothing.

**Solution**:
- Focus on current task only
- Don't worry about task 142
- One task at a time
- Celebrate small wins
